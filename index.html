    <h2>Dancing is cool, right? Unless you're not that great at the dance. Dance is fun... 
      Even if you THINK you're not good at it!
    I also like music. Piano, viola, a little bit of ukulele... I don't practice the ukulele that much though... Whoops!
      This is my first page that I've ever coded... it's cool, but not amazing.</h2>
