    <h2>Dancing is cool, right? Unless you're not that great at the dance. Dance is fun... 
      Even if you THINK you're not good at it!
    I also like music. Piano, viola, a little bit of ukulele... I don't practice the ukulele that much though... Whoops!
      This is my first page that I've ever coded... it's cool, but not amazing.</h2>
  
      <h2>I have a cat. Her name is Gracie, and she's SOOOOOOO lazy! She's a Tordie Tabby so she's pretty much all the colors a
    cat could be. I love cats and dog lovers, so don't attack me I just have a cat because I used to have a dog, but he died
    :(. I love animals they're SOOOOOO cute!</h2>
    
    <h2>You're gonna need to prepare yourself for this paragraph. I LOVE Kpop! My favorite band is BTS!! Don't Attack me...
      I also love Seventeen, Blackpink and EXO!! My bias in BTS is J-hope OMG HE'S AN AMAZING DANCER AND THAT'S WHY I LIKE TO
      DANCE AHHHHH!!!</h2>
